% Inputs: - borders:     Superpixel borders, images with holes to fill.
%                        The borders must be set to 1.
%         - fill_border: Option setting the filling of borders. Can be set
%                        to 1 to obtain a label map from superpixels
%                        borders.
% Output: - label_map:   Each closed region is filled with a label.
