## Superpixel toolbox to manipulate superpixel segmentation on MATLAB

### Overview

- Simple functions to get superpixel borders, adjacency matrix, label map, centers, etc.  
- Metrics evaluating color homogeneity (explained variation, intra-cluster variation), regularity (circularity) and respect of image objects (achievable segmentation accuracy) metrics
- Region filling function to get a label map from contours...
